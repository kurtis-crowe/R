# Smoking History and Health: Exploring Correlations Between Lifetime Smoking and Health Indicators

## Objective

The present study seeks to investigate potential correlations between participants who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes throughout their lifetime and their responses to questions Q10 through Q15. Specifically, this study will examine whether there exists any statistically significant relationship between participants' smoking history and their reported physical health (PHYSHLTH), mental health (MENTHLTH), and asthma status (ASTHMA3). By exploring these associations, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the potential impact of smoking on various health indicators, and to inform public health initiatives aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking and its associated health risks.
